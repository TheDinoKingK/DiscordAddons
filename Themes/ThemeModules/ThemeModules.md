# Discord Theme Modules!

This is a very chaotic collection of modular themes I've created (with the help of some people)

They're designed in a way so they can be plopped into your discord with any theme you like!
At least, in theory.

I'm making these themes in discord PTB modded with [vencord](https://vencord.dev/) on windows 10, 
Due to that, it might be broken on other setups

If you do come across any issues or bugs please mention them to me in the issues panel


# The modules

## Collapsible Member lists
server member lists take up much less space unless you hover over them
This was inspired by devEvils take in their [dark+ theme](https://betterdiscord.app/theme/Dark%2B) and used some of mrTipsons "hide server bar" css as a starting point, attempting to collapse the member list while also remaining pretty.
currently it only works with the main member list in servers but other member lists will be fixed as well 


## Nitro Adblocker
I got annoyed by some of the nitro advertising in the application so I decided to remove them entirely, This is very extreme and disables some core functionality that you might care about
for example if you use vencords "fake profile theme" plugin you cannot change the 3y3 code due to the preview being disabled, or use the gift nitro button in the chat


## Nitro Adblocker Minimal
Same as above except it gives you back most of the functionality removed in the 'adblocker' if you'd like access to some features removed from the original theme


## Bottom Horizontal Server Bar
Currently this is simply an edit of mrTipsons horizontal server bar code to anchor itself to the bottom of the screen along with being centered(with the help of Rag404)
I plan to modify it further and anchor other elements to this aswell, but for now it works fine for me :D


## "Slightly" Fancy Chat
Modifies the "chat history" to look a little prettier, mainly by adding shadows everywhere and app-like text message bubbles(which was entirely stolen from [devEvils dark+ theme](https://betterdiscord.app/theme/Dark%2B))
