
# Discord Theme Modules!

This is a very chaotic collection of modular themes I've created (with the help of some people)

They're designed in a way so they can be plopped into your discord with any theme you like!
At least, in theory.

I'm making these themes in discord PTB modded with [vencord](https://vencord.dev/) on windows 10, 
Due to that, it might be broken on other setups

If you do come across any issues or bugs please mention them to me in the issues panel


# The modules

## Collapsible Member list's
server member lists take up much less space unless you hover over them
This was inspired by [devEvils](https://github.com/DevEvil99) take in their [dark+ theme](https://betterdiscord.app/theme/Dark%2B) and used some of [mrTipsons](https://github.com/MrTipson) ["hide server bar"](https://github.com/MrTipson/DiscordCSS/blob/master/css/server-bar-hide.css) css as a starting point, attempting to collapse the member list while also remaining pretty.

currently it only works with the main member list in servers & group chats, but more lists might be collapsed aswell


## Nitro Adblocker
I got annoyed by some of the nitro advertising in the application so I decided to remove them entirely, This is very extreme and disables some core functionality that you might care about

for example, if you use vencords "fake profile theme" plugin you cannot change the 3y3 code due to the preview being disabled, or use the gift nitro button in the chat


## Nitro Adblocker Minimal
Same as above except it gives you back most of the functionality removed in the 'adblocker' if you'd like access to some features removed from the original theme


## Remove Anoying Elements
similar to "Nitro Adblocker" but for miscallanious elements that I dont like. 

for example the annoying activity card in the server members list that takes up space- **AND WONT STAY COLLAPSED FOR SOME REASON??**  


## Bottom Horizontal Server Bar
Currently this is simply an edit of [mrTipsons](https://github.com/MrTipson) ["horizontal server bar" code](https://github.com/MrTipson/DiscordCSS/blob/master/css/server-bar.css) to anchor itself to the bottom of the screen along with being centered(with the help of [Rag404](https://github.com/Rag404))
I plan to modify it further and anchor other elements to this aswell, but for now it works fine for me :D


## "Slightly" Fancy Chat
Modifies the "chat history" to look a little prettier, mainly by adding shadows everywhere and app-like text message bubbles(which was entirely stolen from [devEvils dark+ theme](https://betterdiscord.app/theme/Dark%2B))


## Online Git themes
Pretty much just my vencord online themes in a file so I can disable them whenever I like.


## Misc Tweaks
a bunch of out of order css, either for wip modules or my own personal stuff!
